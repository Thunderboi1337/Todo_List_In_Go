# Todo_List_In_Go
Learn by doing, going to attempt to make a Todo list, seems like a pretty basic project to do in general. So I hope it will help me with the new syntax and I want to do it using CSV. Something I have never stored anything in before, only work with Json for the most part. Should be fun:)
